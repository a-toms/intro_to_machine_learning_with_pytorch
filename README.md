# Introduction to machine learning with pytorch

Neural networks are used as a method of machine learning, one of the many subfields of artificial intelligence. They were first proposed around 70 years ago as an attempt at simulating the way the human brain works, though in a much more simplified form.

In recent years, due to advancements in hardware development, we have been able to build very deep neural networks, and train them on enormous datasets to achieve breakthroughs in machine intelligence.

In this workshop, you will implement a small subsection of image classification â€”digit recognition. Using Pytorch, an open-source Python library developed by Facebook, you will take hand-drawn images of the numbers 0-9 and build and train a neural network to recognise and predict the correct labels for the digits displayed.

This repository contains instructions for setting up your own development environment to get you started with machine and deep learning technologies. Workshop assignments for _intro to ML workshop_ is included in the `notebooks` folder.

## Prequisites

While you won't need prior experience in practical machine learning or Pytorch to follow along with this class, we'll assume some familiarity with:

- Python programming language: See [Udacity - Intro to Python](https://eu.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110)
- High school linear algebra: See [3Blue1Brown - Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc)
- Multivariable Calculus:  See- [Khanacademy - Introduction to Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)

## Steps

This workshop consists of two activities:

1. Setting up your development environment, downloading the required packages and testing everything works.
2. Completing the Jupyter notebook assignments.

> Note: If you get stuck, take a look at the solutions notebook. It is recommended that you solve your problem as far as you can via googling. Only refer to the solutions notebook if you are frustrated.

## Flow

1. Download and install Anaconda.
2. Setup your environment using the instructions within the `setup` folder.
3. Clone this git reposiroty using `git clone https://github.com/beginners-machine-learning-london/intro_to_machine_learning_with_pytorch.git`
4. Open Jupyter Notebook and complete the code snippets.
5. Use the Pytorch documentation as required when you get stuck to find example codes you can use.
6. Train the model.
7. Measure the accuracy of your trained model. What is the accuracy?
